  <h1>The History of the Lottery</h1>
  <div class="card">
    <p>The concept of a lottery, or drawing lots to determine a winner, dates back to ancient times. The first recorded signs of a lottery are keno slips from the Chinese Han Dynasty between 205 and 187 BC. These lotteries are believed to have helped finance major government projects like the Great Wall of China.</p>
    <p>In Europe, the Roman Empire held the first lotteries, which were primarily for entertainment at dinner parties. Each guest would receive a ticket, and prizes would be awarded to a few lucky winners. However, some lotteries had a more serious purpose, such as funding repairs for the city of Rome.</p>
    <p>The modern lottery as we know it began to emerge in the 15th century in the Low Countries. These lotteries were held to raise money for town fortifications and to help the poor. In the 17th century, it was common in the Netherlands to organize lotteries to collect money for a variety of public and private purposes.</p>
    <p>Today, lotteries are a global phenomenon, with billions of dollars spent on tickets every year. They are a significant source of revenue for governments around the world, funding everything from education and healthcare to infrastructure and the arts.</p>
